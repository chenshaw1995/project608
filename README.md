This files is designed as a web application myapp.
it is composed of "MVC" (MODEL, CONTROLLER, VIEW).
I complete this app on cloud9. 
If you have ruby on rails, you could run it with the command "rails server" on local computer.
Or you could see this app on heroku :https://database-pj1.herokuapp.com/.

If you run it on local computer, please set up and start postgresql, then run

$rails db:seed
Without these two commands, you could not open this web application.
